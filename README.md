# dmoj-submissions
My submissions to the Don Mills Online Judge from when I was in high school, using a mix of Python 3, C++, and Java.

## Disclaimer
These submissions were optimized for speed (or at least attempted to be) and were coded with a very "code golf-y" mindset. As a result, the variable names are often uninsightful and confusing shortcuts and one-liners are frequently used.

View with discretion!
